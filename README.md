# user_engagment_task5
The data is available as two attached CSV files:

takehome_user_engagement.csv

takehome_users.csv

Define an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into the product on three separate days in at least one seven-day period. Identify which factors predict future user adoption.

Please refer to the file named User Engagement Project.ipynb for the Python code I did for this project.
